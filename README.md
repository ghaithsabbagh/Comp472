The code is for Jupyter Notebook.

The cells in the code have to be run in order from top to bottom. The path for the files have to be changed for every user.

How to Run the Code:

Each Model is done in a different code to making running of the code easier instead of changing files.
1. Run the Task1.ipynb first found in the Code File, this is the word2vec-google-news-300 model. Make sure to change the file paths to your files paths.
2. Run the other codes in any order.
3. Output files (csv files) should also be put in your own path.
4. Analysis file will be complete after running all codes.
